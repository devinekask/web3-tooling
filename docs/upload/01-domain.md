# Register your domain

This first step demonstrates how you can register your domain so that you have your own url. Think about the name of your domain because you will use it during your studies to build a portfolio. A url like [http://party-animal-4-life.be](http://party-animal-4-life.be) does not look very professional in a job interview.
